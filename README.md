## Pitch
Wouldnâ€™t it be great to know how busy chaus (or any public place) is before showing up and realizing that the line is too long? To do this, we can build a system that monitors the crowdedness of a place (e.g. Rice Coffeehouse) and reports both its real time and predicted business in a simple frontend to the users. We can set up a WiFi-enabled Raspberry Pi in the place of interest that monitors how many WiFi devices are nearby. The Pi can upload this data to a backend, which would do some processing and then store it in a database. The frontend can then query this information and display it to users.

# Usage


## Frontend (React App)

```bash
# Setup
cd frontend
npm install

# Test
npm run test

# Run
npm run start
```

## Backend (Flask Server)

```bash
# Setup
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Test
python3 -m unittest discover ./test

# Run
python3 app.py
```

The backend is deployed via heroku with: `git subtree push --prefix backend heroku main`


## Read IT Data (Python Script)

This script reads data from the GitLab provided by IT and updates the backend with new data.

```bash
# Setup
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run
python3 read_IT_data.py
```
