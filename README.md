## Pitch
Wouldn’t it be great to know how busy chaus (or any public place) is before showing up and realizing that the line is too long? To do this, we can build a system that monitors the crowdedness of a place (e.g. Rice Coffeehouse) and reports both its real time and predicted business in a simple frontend to the users. We can set up a WiFi-enabled Raspberry Pi in the place of interest that monitors how many WiFi devices are nearby. The Pi can upload this data to a backend, which would do some processing and then store it in a database. The frontend can then query this information and display it to users.

# Usage

## Frontend (React App)

```bash
# Setup
cd frontend
npm install

# Test
npm run test

# Run
npm run start
```

## Backend (Flask Server)

```bash
# Setup
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Test
python3 -m unittest discover ./test

# Run
python3 server.py
```

The backend is deployed via heroku with: `git subtree push --prefix backend heroku main`

## Sensor (Python Script)

## Convenience Scripts

1. `./RunApp` will run both the frontend and the backend.
2. `./TestApp` will test both the frontend and the backend.
